What is a tornado?

This is actually a topic with recent development from 2014

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276996454_A_Revised_Tornado_Definition_and_Changes_in_Tornado_Taxonomy

This is a paper that goes over what a Tornado actually is, and this is the currently accepted taxonomy of tornadoes
It ammends another Tornado taxonomy paper from 2009 by Agee and Jones (Agee is the author of this paper)

The other predecessors were:
Glickman, T., Ed., 2000: Tornado. Glossary of Meteorology. 2nded. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 585
Huschke, R. E., Ed., 1959: Tornado. Glossary of Meteorology.Amer. Meteor. Soc., 781


In both the 1958 and 2000 papers, they are built on multiple 'species' of tornadoes

----------

Tornadoes Before 1958: The Key Points
No formal classification system.

Tornadoes were often identified based on appearance
(funnel cloud, shape) and destructive power (general damage).

Some anecdotal and observational descriptions of tornadoes
were based on severity or size.

Tornadoes were typically classified only in broad, qualitative
terms, like "weak" or "strong" based on their impact.


----------

1958 Paper - Original:
The 1958 tornado taxonomy proposed the following species:

Funnel-type Tornado: This was the most common type, defined by a visible 
funnel-shaped cloud extending from the thunderstorm base to the ground.

Water-spout-type Tornado: This species referred to tornadoes that occurred over water, 
typically forming in association with waterspouts, and were often less intense than their funnel-type counterparts.

Dust Devil-type Tornado: This type was related to dust devils, which are smaller, 
weak vortexes that typically form in clear, hot conditions. They were categorized 
as a distinct "species" in the 1958 taxonomy but were not as intense or destructive as other tornadoes.

-----

2000 Paper added species:

The 2000 tornado taxonomy refined and expanded upon the 1958 classification. 
It kept similar categories but with more clarification and differentiation:

Classic Tornado: The typical funnel-type tornado, which forms from thunderstorms and 
is characterized by a visible rotating column of air.

Waterspout: Tornadoes occurring over bodies of water, generally less intense than 
land-based tornadoes but still capable of causing damage.

Dust Devil: These are weak, small vortices typically found over land in dry, warm conditions.
They were seen as a tornado-like phenomenon but much weaker in terms of wind speed and intensity.

Landspout: A category that was introduced in the 2000 paper, referring to weak, short-lived
tornadoes that form in conditions similar to those of dust devils, but can also occur in the presence of thunderstorms.

-----

2009 paper moved away from the concept of 'species' - and made it 2 main types:


1. Supercell Tornadoes: These are the most well-known and studied type of tornado, formed from the rotating 
updraft (mesocyclone) of a supercell thunderstorm.

2. Non-supercell Tornadoes (NSPs): Tornadoes not associated with supercells, which include:

    - Landspouts: These are weak tornadoes formed from a non-rotating updraft in a storm,
    often observed over land, resembling dust devils in appearance.

    - Gustnadoes: These are short-lived tornadoes associated with strong wind gusts near 
    the gust front of a thunderstorm.

    - Waterspouts: Tornadoes that form over water, similar to tornadoes on land but typically weaker.

-----

The 2013 paper revised this by removing landspouts and gustnadoes from the Type 2 category
and added a third type:


1. Supercell Tornadoes

    - Classic Supercell Tornadoes

    - Weak Supercell Tornadoes

2. Non-Supercell Tornadoes

    - Landspouts

    - Gustnadoes

    - Other Non-Supercell Tornadoes

3. Hybrid Tornadoes

    - Transitional Tornadoes

    - Other Hybrid Forms


------

These are more descriptive definitions of the current type and sub type:

1. Supercell Tornadoes
Description: Tornadoes that form within the context of a supercell thunderstorm, 
which has a rotating updraft (mesocyclone).

    Subtypes:

        - Classic Supercell Tornadoes: Typically the most violent and long-lived, 
        associated with large, well-developed supercells.

        - Weak Supercell Tornadoes: Tornadoes from weaker supercells, generally 
        smaller and shorter-lived.

2. Non-Supercell Tornadoes
Description: Tornadoes that do not form from a supercell, including those produced 
by smaller-scale weather features.

    Subtypes:

        - Landspouts: Tornadoes that form from a convective cloud base, but do not 
        involve a mesocyclone.

        - Gustnadoes: Tornado-like circulations that form along the outflow boundary
        of a thunderstorm.

        - Other Non-Supercell Tornadoes: Tornadoes that form in various meteorological
        settings not involving supercells, such as those from squall lines or other smaller
        storm systems.

3. Hybrid Tornadoes
Description: Tornadoes that exhibit characteristics of both supercell and non-supercell tornadoes.

    Subtypes:

        - Transitional Tornadoes: Tornadoes that may begin as non-supercell tornadoes
        but develop into supercell tornadoes, or vice versa, during their lifecycle.

        - Other Hybrid Forms: Tornadoes that share a mix of characteristics, not easily
        classified as purely supercell or non-supercell.

From this I can say that there were less 'types' of tornadoes before 1958,
and this could have affected the records because, there was a lower resolution of defintions

They were built more on destructive power, and visual taxonomy rather than
a more scientific one

=======

I predict that the data will show a slight boom after 1958

My hypothesis is that there were more reported tornadoes due to there
being a wider definition but the paper also had sociological effects,
where the population were more aware of them.

=======

2000 had an even wider spectrum, so there could potentially be another
knowledge based spike, as well as a sociological one

=======

2009 dropped the number of types, but made the classification more precise

=======

2013 further refined the classification system

=======

What are the circumstances for a Tornado to Occur?

What are the concentrations?
